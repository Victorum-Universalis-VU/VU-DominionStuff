In the 5th century Bordeaux was conquered by the Visigoths, shortly afterwards by the Franks. At the latest after the division of the partial kingdom by Charibert I of Paris, i.e. in 567, Bordeaux belonged to Neustria. After the marriage of the Neustrian king Chilperich I, however, he gave the city, together with Cahors, Limoges, Bearn and Bigorre as a morning gift to his bride Gailswintha. These five cities were strategically located to the territory of the father-in-law Athanagild, king of the Visigoths. After Chilperich had arranged for his wife to be murdered, this inheritance passed to the kingdom of Austrasia, following a ruling by a Malberg convened by Guntram, king of the Burgundians. Ultimately disagreeing with this, Chilperich, with his son Clovis as his commander, attempted to reconquer the cities in 573. Although the conquest of Bordeaux was briefly successful, Clovis' troops were driven out again just one month later by the Austrasian margrave Sigulf. In 732, Abd ar-Rahman devastated the city during his campaign. After the defeat of the Arabs at Poitiers, they were pushed back behind the Pyrenees, but in the 9th century the Normans invaded and plundered the city again. Only then did Bordeaux begin to recover. A turning point occurred when Eleanor of Aquitaine made the French southwest an English fief by marrying Henry II. From the 12th to the 15th century, Bordeaux remained under the rule of the kings of England and experienced a second economic flourishing. The city was provided with a new city wall and the Romanesque church was replaced by a Gothic building, the Saint-André Cathedral. Bordeaux was the seat of an archbishop and the capital of the principality of Guyenne, the English adaptation of the French term Aquitaine. "

In the Middle Ages, the characteristics of the coast and the dangers of the open sea forced all maritime traffic between northern and southern Europe to pass by the foot of the cliff and the Abbey of Saint-Mathieu, on which Brest, one of the most important ports of the West, depended at the time. In fact, the Penfeld is an excellent natural harbour. It is sheltered and almost hidden behind a rock of about 200 metres at its longest point, which plunged into the water on two sides and was isolated from the land by a ravine on its third side. Brest is alternately under the rule of the Duke of Brittany and the Kingdom of England. During the War of the Succession of Brittany in 1341, Monfort gave custody of the town to the English. After becoming Duke of Brittany, he tried in vain to drive out the invaders. The King of France also failed.

In 50 BC, the Roman port city of Portus Namnetus was founded on the site of the present-day city of Nantes, named after the Namnetians who lived there. In the third century, the inhabitants converted to Christianity. Around the year 285, the Saxons invaded the region. From the 4th century, Nantes was the seat of a bishopric. In the 5th and 6th centuries, Bretons allegedly arrived from the British Isles. Charlemagne subdued Brittany, but it revolted under his successors. The first fire raid by the Loire Normans is recorded for the year 843. Nominoë, who ruled Brittany at the time, conquered Nantes in 850 and had its walls razed because the city had allied itself with Charles the Bald. In 919 Nantes fell to the Normans, but they were driven out again in 936. Around this time, the rivalry between the Counts of Nantes and the Counts of Rennes began, who fought for supremacy over Brittany. In 1154, Nantes was given to Henry II, who ascended the English throne in that year. In 1203, the county of Nantes came to an end. Peter Mauclerc was made Duke of Brittany in 1213 by the French King Philip II. August as Duke of Brittany and made Nantes his capital. He had Nantes surrounded with fortifications and defended the city against John Ohneland. The city also developed into his important seaport from the 14th century. During the War of the Breton Succession (1341-64), the city initially sided with John of Montfort, but surrendered to Charles of Blois in November 1341. Ultimately, however, the Montforts were victorious, becoming Breton dukes in 1364 and choosing Nantes as their main residence. In 1460, the University was founded in Nantes by Duke Francis II of Brittany and confirmed by Pope Pius II. "

It was called a burgus (bourg), was the centre of an extensive ducal domain, lay at the crossroads of important roads and had markets as well as a harbour.  He had a strong fortress built in Caen as well as an abbey for women (Abbaye aux dames) and one for men (Abbaye aux hommes) around 1059, where he was also buried. William's tombstone can still be seen in the church today. The English King William II and his brother, Duke Robert II of Normandy, concluded a treaty in Caen in 1091 in which they settled their disputes. If the Norman conquest of England (1066) had already promoted the further development of Caen, it benefited equally from the burning of the rival city of Bayeux in 1105. Caen developed into a centre of intellectual life - for example, the theologian Thibaud of Étampes († after 1120) studied here - and became one of the main residences of King Henry I († 1135), then the administrative centre of Normandy in the late 12th century. The French King Philip II. August was able to take possession of Caen without resistance in May 1204 and confirmed the liberties granted to the city by John Ohneland on 17 June 1203. However, it lost some of its previous status as a political and intellectual centre.  Louis IX stayed here in 1256 and 1269. Caen now had an important textile industry, whose products such as sheets and linen fabrics were exported mainly to Italy. Trade contacts with England, on the other hand, declined. In the early stages of the Hundred Years' War, the city was conquered and plundered by King Edward III of England on 26 July 1346, before he moved on with his army and fought the Battle of Crécy, which was victorious for him. On 8 October 1346, Caen received permission from King Philip VI of France to build strong city walls. King Henry V of England conquered Caen in September 1417, and most of the inhabitants preferred not to emigrate. During the reign of the Duke of Bedford, the University of Caen was founded in January 1432 and began official teaching in 1436. "

In 154 BC, the Romans established themselves in the area after the Greek settlements of Nikaia and Antipolis, had been attacked by Ligurians from the area of Biot and Cannes. To secure the region, the Romans then built a second settlement, Cemenelum, next to Nikaia on the mountains of Cimiez. The place was thus a regional administrative centre and experienced a boom, especially due to the construction of the Via Julia Augusta (7 BC), so that the base grew into a town around this time. In the fifth century, Cemenelum was abandoned in favour of Nikaia. Provence fell to the Ostrogoths in 508, and to the Frankish Empire in 536. In 813, 859 and 880, Nice was sacked by Saracen attackers who came from the sea. In 1144 a city council ("consulate") is mentioned, in 1176 a first city constitution. However, Nice remained subject to the County of Provence, so that the city was Aragonese in the 12th century and belonged to the House of Anjou from 1246. In the 13th century, competition with Genoa became increasingly noticeable, which even briefly gained suzerainty over the city around 1215. In response, the Count of Provence had a fleet stationed in Nice around 1250. In 1295, the town of Villefranche was founded near Nice with a base to combat piracy. In 1385, after the death of the sovereign Joan I, succession turmoil ensued when Charles of Anjou and his cousin Charles of Durazzo claimed the county of Provence for themselves. In this situation, Nice turned against the Anjous at the instigation of Lord Jean Grimaldi, whereupon in 1388 Duke Amadeus VII of Savoy annexed the eastern part of Provence to his dukedom as Terre Neuve de Provence and later as the County of Nice (French - Comte de Nice), which thus gained access to the sea. Because of its strategic location, the town was heavily fortified and was subsequently always fought over. "

The Dukes of Gascony, who drove out the Normans towards the end of the 10th century, gave the town many privileges. The inhabitants gradually settled outside the city walls.

In documents, the Roman name Lapurdum was now replaced by the Basque name Baya one. The English obtained Bayonne in 1152 when the Duchess Eleanor of Aquitaine married Henry (II). They raised the liberties and prosperity of the city, which was granted municipal rights by King John Ohneland in 1215. The inhabitants sent a total of 30 galleys to the English in 1224 to support La Rochelle against Louis VIII of France. From 1291, Bayonne was in a trade war with Normandy, prompting the war between France and England; it was occupied by the French from 1293-1295.

The second syllable mond probably comes from the term "monte" for an elevation. What is meant is a castle hill, an old fortification called a motte - Roermond therefore means "Rurburg". According to another interpretation, "mond" is derived from the Latin mundium - city, i.e. "city on the Rur" or "Rur bridge" with the Celtic-Germanic "monde" for "bridge". The urban origins go back to the Romans. An altar stone dedicated to the goddess Rura found in the town area dates back to the 3rd century A.D. Caesar is said to have named the Roman town "Villa Optima", meaning "best place to live". The oldest surviving document mentioning Roermond dates from 1130; at that time it belonged to the Duchy of Guelders. In 1213, Roermond was destroyed by the German Emperor Otto IV. During the subsequent reconstruction, the construction of the cathedral abbey also began in 1224, of which the Liebfrauen Minster Church still remains today.

 urban_brussels_desc:0 "Brussels is a city within the Flemish Region. Brussels grew from a small rural settlement on the river Senne to become an important city in Europe. The history of Brussels is closely linked to that of Western Europe. Traces of human settlement go back to the Stone Age, with vestiges and place-names related to the civilisation of megaliths, dolmens and standing stones (Plattesteen near the Grand-Place/Grote Markt and Tomberg in Woluwe-Saint-Lambert, for example). During late antiquity, the region was home to Roman occupation, as attested by archaeological evidence discovered on the current site of Tour & Taxis, north-west of the Pentagon (Brussels' city centre). Following the decline of the Western Roman Empire, it was incorporated into the Frankish Empire. Lambert I of Leuven, Count of Leuven, gained the County of Brussels around 1000, by marrying Charles' daughter. Because of its location on the banks of the Senne, on an important trade route between Bruges and Ghent, and Cologne, Brussels became a commercial centre specialised in the textile trade. The town grew quite rapidly and extended towards the upper town (Treurenberg, Coudenberg and Sablon/Zavel areas), where there was a smaller risk of floods. As it grew to a population of around 30,000, the surrounding marshes were drained to allow for further expansion. Around this time, work began on what is now the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. Gudula (1225), replacing an older Romanesque church. In 1183, the Counts of Leuven became Dukes of Brabant. Brabant, unlike the county of Flanders, was not fief of the king of France but was incorporated into the Holy Roman Empire. In the early 13th century, the first walls of Brussels were built, and after this, the city grew significantly."

After the division of the Frankish Empire, which began in 843, and further, mostly warlike divisions of the Middle Kingdom, Antwerp became part of the Eastern Frankish Empire, the early medieval forerunner of the Holy Roman Empire. The Ottonians founded the Margraviate of Antwerp, which was part of the Duchy of Lower Lorraine. In the 11th century, the most famous leader of the First Crusade (1096-1099), Godfrey of Bouillon, was originally Margrave of Antwerp from 1076 until his death in 1100, but later also Duke of Lower Lorraine (1087-1100) and Defender of the Holy Sepulchre (1099-1100). In the 12th century, Norbert of Xanten founded a community of his Premonstratensian canons at the Abbey of St Michael in Caloes. At the beginning of the 12th century it came to the Counts of Louvain (the later Dukes of Brabant). The place was granted city rights in 1291.  Antwerp was also the headquarters of Edward III during his early negotiations with Jacob van Artevelde, and his son Lionel, the Duke of Clarence, was born there in 1338.

Bruges was a location of coastal settlement during prehistory. This Bronze Age and Iron Age settlement are unrelated to medieval city development. In the Bruges area, the first fortifications were built after Julius Caesar's conquest of the Menapii in the first century BC, to protect the coastal area against pirates. The Franks took over the whole region from the Gallo-Romans around the fourth century and administered it as the Pagus Flandrensis. The Viking incursions of the ninth century prompted Count Baldwin I of Flanders to reinforce the Roman fortifications; trade soon resumed with England and Scandinavia. Early medieval habitation starts in the ninth and tenth centuries on the Burgh terrain, probably with a fortified settlement and church. Bruges had a strategic location at the crossroads of the northern Hanseatic League trade, who had a kontor in the city, and the southern trade routes. Bruges was already included in the circuit of the Flemish and French cloth fairs at the beginning of the 13th century, but when the old system of fairs broke down, the entrepreneurs of Bruges innovated. They developed, or borrowed from Italy, new forms of merchant capitalism, whereby several merchants would share the risks and profits and pool their knowledge of markets. They employed new forms of economic exchange, including bills of exchange (i.e. promissory notes) and letters of credit. The city eagerly welcomed foreign traders, most notably the Portuguese traders selling pepper and other spices."

The first historical document about the existence of an established settlement in Madrid dates from the Muslim age. In the second half of the 9th century, Umayyad Emir Muhammad I built a fortress on a headland near the river Manzanares as one of the many fortresses he ordered to be built on the border between Al-Andalus and the kingdoms of Leon and Castile, with the objective of protecting Toledo from the Christian invasions and also as a starting point for Muslim offensives. After the disintegration of the Caliphate of Cordoba in the early 11th century, Madrid was integrated in the Taifa of Toledo. n the context of the wider campaign for the conquest of the taifa of Toledo initiated in 1079, Madrid was seized in 1083 by Alfonso VI of Leon and Castile, who sought to use the town as an offensive outpost against the city of Toledo, in turn conquered in 1085."

In the 7th/8th century, the area around Burgos was reconquered from the hands of the Moors by the kings of Asturias. A castle was built in 884 by the Castilian Count Diego Rodríguez Porcelos on the orders of King Alfonso III of Asturias as an important fortification in the fight against the Moors. In 931, Fernán González, the first Count of Castile independent of the Kingdom of León, named Burgos the capital of his dominion. Burgos rose to become the coronation city of the kings of Castile in the 11th century, which underlines its special importance. The city's immediate neighbourhood was also the birthplace of the most famous Spanish hero of the Middle Ages, Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, known as El Cid, who is buried with his wife Jimena in Burgos Cathedral, which was only built later. After the conquest of Toledo by Alfonso VI (1085), Burgos lost some of its importance, but it remained an important economic, cultural and political centre in northern Spain. Some Spanish cities were founded from Burgos, such as Bilbao, a foundation confirmed by King Fernando IV of Castile on 4 January 1301. Burgos was an important stopover for pilgrims on the French Way, the most popular route to Santiago de Compostela, and a commercial centre between the Bay of Biscay and the south, attracting an unusually large foreign merchant population that became part of the urban oligarchy and excluded other foreigners. During the 13th and 14th centuries, Burgos was a favourite seat of the kings of León and Castile and a favoured burial place. In the 14th century, official royal interference in the city's affairs was perceived as a palliative against outbreaks of violence by the large excluded class of smaller merchants and artisans on whom the tax burden fell. The alguacil was the royal official appointed to adjudicate disagreements. On 9 June 1345, Alfonso XI swept aside the municipal government and established direct royal rule over Burgos through the regimiento of sixteen appointed men. "

In many of the maps and documents from the 13th century onwards, Santander is referred to as San Andrés, San André, Sant Ander and Sant Andero.  In 1248, Santander took part in the battle to conquer Seville, along with other Cantabrian towns, and as a reward received a coat of arms with representations of the Torre del Oro and the river Guadalquivir. King Alfonso X designated the city as Sant Ander in 1255, when he granted his brother the right to appoint mayors and jurors. By order of the king, shipyards were built to exploit the forests of the Cantabrian woods for the construction of ships. The city was obliged to provide the monarchy with one ship per year. On 4 May 1296, the Cantabrian coastal towns formed the Brotherhood of the Cities of the Navy of Castile with Vitoria or Brotherhood of the Marshes. Their aim was to strengthen their commercial position against the competition from the other side of the Bay of Biscay, especially in the trade of wool and flour with the cities of Flanders and England. In 1296 and 1311, the town of Sant Emeterio was destroyed by two fires. King Ferdinand IV of Castile exempted the town from 'the tithe of all food that came from outside my kingdom' because of the disaster. In the 14th century, the Book of the Merinities of Castile (known as the Calf of the Behetrias) confirms this condition, that of the Behetry, for the city, i.e. it defines it as dependent only on the monarchy, without any other feudal lord except the prerogatives of the abbot. Tensions between the Old and New Towns, led by the Giles and Negretes clans, forced the monarchy to regulate the governance of the town in the 15th century, placing two mayors (one for each town) and several aldermen.

In the 6th century, large parts of the city were destroyed by the invading Visigoths and only later rebuilt by the Moors. In 1139, the King of León, Ferdinand II. (León), succeeded in conquering the city. In 1165, the city was taken by Geraldo the Fearless, a Portuguese adventurer who created an independent principality in Extremadura, but was dispossessed by force. As the kingdom was unable to organise its defence, the city was handed over to the newly founded Order of Santiago. As early as 1179, the city had to be abandoned again and it was not until 1229 that Alfonso IX finally succeeded in capturing the city for the Kingdom of León. The reconquered city was granted privileges by Alfonso IX and Cáceres was fashioned as a royal city, directly dependent on the Leonese crown and with no local government other than its own council. By this charter, the Crown reserved for itself a considerable portion of land between those of the Order of Santiago and those of the Order of Alcántara. The prohibition of state property contained in this fuero prevented the formation of a strong nobility, so the city was ruled by a mesocracy of agricultural knights. In the 15th century, the city suffered from the internal disputes of the nobility. The Catholic Monarchs issued several decrees and regulations to try to pacify the local nobility."

 urban_roma_desc:0 "Rome, also known as the 'Eternal City' is a major city of Italy with a history spanning 28 centuries. While Roman mythology dates the founding of Rome at around 753 BC, the site has been inhabited for much longer, making it a major human settlement for almost three millennia and one of the oldest continuously occupied cities in Europe. The city's early population originated from a mix of Latins, Etruscans, and Sabines. Eventually, the city successively became the capital of the Roman Kingdom, the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire, and is regarded by many as the first-ever Imperial city and metropolis. It was first called The Eternal City by the Roman poet Tibullus in the 1st century BC, and the expression was also taken up by Ovid, Virgil, and Livy. Rome is also called 'Caput Mundi' (Capital of the World). In the year 300, Rome reached its greatest population of an estimated 1.2 million inhabitants. The city soon lost political importance, however, as the various emperors preferred other residences. After the end of the Western Roman Empire, it was not until the reign of Pippin that Rome regained its importance as the capital of the Papal States and as the most important place of pilgrimage for Christianity alongside Jerusalem and Santiago de Compostela. New splendour came to the city in 800, when Charlemagne was crowned Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire by Pope Leo III. At that time, the population was just 20,000. Due to the rapid decline in population, a good three quarters of the city area enclosed by the Aurelian Wall became deserted and lay fallow, becoming overgrown and later used for agriculture. The ancient city centres, the Roman Forum, the Capitol, the imperial fora, the Colosseum etc. all lay in the uninhabited disabitato."  
 urban_parma_desc:0 "The history of the city dates back to the Etruscans. The Roman consul Marcus Aemilius Lepidus founded the city of Colonia Iulia Augusta Parmensis on the right bank of the river Parma in 184 BC with the status of a Roman colony. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, it was ruled by various powers over the next centuries - the Ostrogoths, Lombards, Frankish Palatines. Under Frankish rule, Parma became the capital of a county in 774. Like most northern Italian cities, it was nominally part of the Holy Roman Empire created by Charlemagne, but was ruled locally by its bishops, the first being Guibodus. In the subsequent battles between the papacy and the empire, Parma was usually a member of the imperial party. Two of its bishops became antipopes - Càdalo, the founder of the cathedral, as Honorius II, and Guibert as Clement III. Around 1140, an almost independent municipality was established; a treaty between Parma and Piacenza in 1149 is the earliest document of a municipality governed by consuls. After the Peace of Constance in 1183 confirmed the Italian municipalities' right to self-government, long-standing disputes with the neighbouring municipalities of Reggio Emilia, Piacenza and Cremona intensified with the aim of controlling the vital trade line across the Po. The struggle between Guelphs and Ghibellines was also present in Parma. In 1213, their podestà was the Guelph Rambertino Buvalelli. After a long struggle alongside the emperors, the papist families of the city won control in 1248. In 1247-48 the city was besieged by Emperor Frederick II, but was crushed in the ensuing battle. Parma fell under the control of Milan in 1341. After a brief period of independence under the Terzi family (1404-1409), the Sforza asserted their rule (from 1440) through their associated Pallavicino, Rossi, Sanvitale and Da Correggio families."

 urban_firenze_desc:0 "Florence was established after 59 BC by Julius Caesar as a colonia named Florentia (after the Roman goddess of flowers and plant growth) in the fertile but still partly marshy Arno valley. The colonia consisted firstly of a military camp, the castrum. The favourable location at the crossroads of the Via Cassia leading to Rome, the Etruscan road (Volterana) coming from Volterra and the likewise Etruscan Pisana, which led to the sea via Pisa, favoured the rapid flourishing of the city on the basis of trade and crafts. The older Etruscan settlements, especially the important Fiesole, situated on a hill to the north of the new city, quickly fell behind as a result. After the Etruscan cities of Volterra and Chiusi as well as the Roman coloniae of Pistoia and Lucca had been outranked alongside Fiesole, Emperor Diocletian named Florence the capital of the Seventh Region (Tuscany and Umbria). In the course of the Byzantine wars of reconquest, the city was almost completely destroyed and only revived under the Lombards. However, since the Lombard dukes resided in Lucca and Pisa, Florence was unable to regain its importance before the Migration Period until the 12th century. The transfer of the official residence of Margrave Hugo, who was appointed by the Carolingians, to Florence around 1000 was decisive for the city's revival. With the rise of feudalism, the city expanded in the 12th century and finally became autonomous. The burghers gained power and there were bitter quarrels between the Ghibellines, who were loyal to the emperor, and the later victorious supporters of the pope, the Guelfs. In the 14th and 15th centuries, the city flourished and set the standard for European art and culture. Many artists and scholars settled here, including Donatello, Botticelli; later Michelangelo, Machiavelli, Leonardo da Vinci and Galileo Galilei. The cultural-historical epoch of the Renaissance developed. " 
 urban_pisa_desc:0 "Pisa was founded as an Etruscan port in the middle 6th century BC. The Etruscans called the city 'Pise' and boosted the city's economy through art and ship production. The city was strategically ideally located, being on the Arno River and at the same time so close to the sea. Pisa's power also grew because of its expansion to the banks of the Arno. The port attracted merchants from all over the Mediterranean and during the 11th and 12th centuries Pisa became a maritime republic. From then on, Pisa became a successful conqueror and prevented Islamic expansion, reaching the Sicilian coast, North Africa and Sardinia. The first Archbishop of Pisa, Daiberto, was in command of Pisa's fleet during the First Crusade and became Patriarch of Jerusalem. Thanks to the strength of the fleet, Pisa founded colonies in the Middle East. Pisa also founded colonies in northern Africa and in various Byzantine centres, such as Constantinople. In the 12th century, Pisa was militarily and economically the most important city, overtaking even Venice. From the middle of the 12th century, Pisa expanded inland into Tuscany - to the south towards Piombino and Valdarno. The 14th century is rich in internal and external tensions. The period of the Republic was very important in terms of cultural and scientific discoveries. In 1324 Pisa lost Sardinia, ruled by the Crown of Aragon, and the entire 13th century was marked by terrible repressions against Lucca and Florence. In 1406 Pisa was conquered by the Florentines. After the Florentine conquest, Pisa went through a period of severe regression and political instability."

However, the city only gained its real importance in the Middle Ages. Like other Italian cities, it gradually became independent and had a consular government in the 12th century. In the dispute between the emperor and the papacy, Siena - unlike Florence - was on the Ghibelline side and thus received various privileges. Essentially, however, this conflict concealed an economic rivalry between the two trading cities. The Florentines were defeated in the Battle of Montaperti in 1260. The following years, however, brought a decline for the Ghibellines. Within the city there were repeated political power struggles, but these did not prevent the city from flourishing economically. The Sienese formed an alliance with Gian Galeazzo Visconti in 1389, accepted his supremacy ten years later and gave up the liberties of their state. The Great Western Schism, which stirred up the Christian world, again brought unrest to Siena. As a consequence of the decisions of the Council of Pisa, Florence and Siena had declared themselves against Gregory XII (1409). As a supporter of the Pope, Ladislaus of Naples therefore took the opportunity to carry out raids on Siena's territory, laying it waste and threatening the city. The Sienese resisted fiercely until the death of this monarch in 1414 freed them from the attacks. Another war with Florence broke out in 1431, caused by the Florentine efforts over Lucca and continued as a result of the Florentine alliance with Venice and Pope Eugene IV and the Sienese alliance with the Duke of Milan and the Roman King Sigismund. The latter monarch stopped in Siena on the way to Rome for his coronation and received a most princely reception. In 1433 the opposing alliances signed a peace treaty, and although it was disadvantageous to the Sienese and they were often tempted to break it, they faithfully adhered to its terms. "

In the run-up to the investiture dispute at Pentecost 1064, a synod was held at this location that resolved the papal schism of the time, which caused the division between the German court and the Roman reform papacy, and confirmed Pope Alexander II as the rightful pontiff against the counter-pope Honorius II.

After 984 it was a fief of Tedalda, Count of Modena and Canossa, a nephew of the Roman-German Emperor Otto I. Ferrara then became independent and was taken by Margravine Matilda in 1101 after a siege. At this time the city was dominated by a small group of important families, including the Adelardi. In 1146 Guglielmo, the last of the Adelardi, died. His property passed to Azzolino d'Este, as did the dowry of his niece Marchesella. Ferrara took part in the Battle of Legnano in 1176 against the Roman-German Emperor Frederick Barbarossa with its own contingent of troops. There was enmity between the newly added family and the Sailinguerra, but after extensive fighting Azzo Novello was appointed permanent Podestà in 1242. In 1259 he captured Ezzelino da Romano of Verona in a battle. His grandson Obizzo II succeeded him and the Pope appointed him Captain General and defender of the Papal States. From then on, the House of Este was nestled in Ferrara. The Po, which had flowed directly past Ferrara in the 12th century, cut a new path north of the city in 1155, making the old riverbed increasingly shallow. In 1391, the University of Ferrara was founded. Niccolò III received several popes with great pomp, especially Eugene IV, who held a council here in 1438. "

The French House of Anjou established a new rule when Charles I of Anjou conquered the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and held it as a fief of the Pope from 1266. After bitter disputes with the Hohenstaufen heirs, Charles I was able to defeat the Hohenstaufen in 1266 and 1268. Under the Angevins, Naples regained considerable importance when they made it the capital of the Kingdom of Sicily. From 1270 onwards, new city walls, new urban areas and a port near the markets to the east were built, as well as numerous churches. The Angevins also built the fortresses Castello del Carmine and Castel Sant'Elmo and, from 1279, the Castel Nuovo, which served both as a defence for the port and as a royal residence. By 1300, Naples already had 50,000 inhabitants. The court's need for luxury stimulated trade, which was dominated above all by Florentines, but also by Genoese, Venetians, Catalans and Marseilles. Even though their rule, which lasted until 1442, was marked by brutal domestic repression, they ensured that the city flourished economically and culturally and took fundamental urban planning measures to modernise it. In 1442, Spaniards, namely the Crown of Aragon under Alfonso, defeated the last ruler of the French Angevins, destroying large parts of the city and the fortified belt already incorporated by suburbs."

In Greek times, the island was called Kyrnos. The dominant naval powers of the time, Carthage and the Etruscans, together defeated the Greeks in the naval battle of Alalia (around 540 BC). Thereafter, Alalia was dominated by the Etruscans until the 3rd century BC. After Carthage briefly regained dominance, Alalia was conquered by the Romans in 259 BC in the First Punic War. With the founding of the colony of Sardinia et Corsica in 227 BC, Corsica became part of the Roman Empire for around 650 years. Still in the final phase of the Western Roman Empire, battles between Vandals and Goths began over the island in the 5th century AD, from which the Vandal king Geiseric emerged victorious. After the conquest of Italy by the Eastern Roman Empire, Corsica became part of the Byzantine Exarchate of Carthage in 536. In the following centuries, the island was disputed under changing regional powers - Byzantines, Lombards, Saracens, Franks, the Margraves of Tuscia and the maritime republics of Pisa and Genoa, but only ever succeeded in establishing themselves in the coastal regions. Above all, the raids by Saracen pirates led to a large part of the population retreating into the interior and the island became increasingly impoverished. Over time, a feudal system developed. In addition, the Catholic Church also gained political authority at that time. From the 14th century, Corsica belonged to the Republic of Genoa, which built a fortification in Bastia. The name Bastia is derived from the Italian name bastiglia. "
 urban_ravenna_desc:0 "In the early and high imperial period, Ravenna was a lagoon city surrounded by water, with at times up to 50,000 inhabitants. In 88 BC the city was granted Roman citizenship. In 402, the Western Roman Emperor Honorius moved his court from Milan to Ravenna, as the city was very defensible. Although some later emperors resided temporarily in Rome, Ravenna remained the clearly preferred seat of government in Italy from then on. The Ostrogoths under Theoderic, who had resided in Ravenna since 493, established an empire in Italy that lasted until their final defeat by Eastern Rome (552). They ruled nominally as deputies of the emperor in Constantinople. Under them, the capital Ravenna once again experienced a period of cultural and economic prosperity until around 535. In 751, the Lombard king Aistulf conquered the city and exarchate, thus ending the exarchate of Ravenna. In the Treaty of Quierzy (754), Pippin the Younger promised to hand over the former Byzantine exarchate of Ravenna to the Holy See; in return, Pope Stephen II legitimised the Carolingians as the new royal dynasty of the Frankish Empire. Until his death, Pippin led two successful campaigns against the Lombards and gave the conquered territories to the Roman See, which Charlemagne confirmed in 774. In 967, Emperor Otto I held an imperial diet in Ravenna. Later, Ravenna led the confederation of cities that grew into an autonomous republic, including Ancona, Fano, Pesaro, Senigallia and Rimini, and was already the seat of an important school of law in the 11th century.

The area was settled in pre-Roman times by the Celtic-Ligurian tribe of the Taurines. One of these settlements was destroyed in 218 BC by Hannibal during his march towards the Alps. In the first century B.C. (probably in 28 B.C.), the Romans built a military camp here (Castra Taurinorum), which was later dedicated to the Emperor Augustus (Augusta Taurinorum). The typical Roman city structure with streets running at right angles to each other has survived to the present day. The Quartiere Romano is the oldest part of the city. In Roman times, Turin had about 5,000 inhabitants, all of whom lived within the high city walls. In 312, the Battle of Turin took place, in which the troops of Emperor Constantine the Great defeated those of his adversary Maxentius. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the city was conquered first by the Lombards, then by the Franks, and was ruled by bishops. At the end of the 13th century, the Dukes of Savoy took the city. The gardens and palaces were built in the 15th century, when the city was rebuilt from scratch. In 1404 the university was founded."

It was only as a colony of the Emperor Augustus that Verona became a large city. Decius defeated the emperor Philippus Arabs here in 249, Constantine Pompeianus in 312. Stilicho succeeded in defeating Alaric here in 402. Attila plundered and devastated the city in 452. Then, along with Pavia and Ravenna, it was the residence of the Ostrogothic king Theoderich, who defeated Odoacer here in 489 and is called Dietrich von Bern in the legend. The old name of the town dates from this time - "Dietrichsbern". The name "Welsch-Bern" (Cimbrian - Bearn) was also used in ancient times. In the 5th and 6th centuries, Verona was not only the residence of the Ostrogoths, but also of the Longobard king Alboin, until it came under the Frankish Empire. In the wake of the devastating Hungarian invasions of Upper Italy from 899 onwards, the heavily fortified city became the seat of a mint after 900, which became the starting point of the Veronese currency area. From 952 Verona belonged to the Margraviate of Verona and thus to the Duchy of Bavaria and (from 976) to Carinthia. It was not until the beginning of the 12th century that Verona became independent and had its own city rights. The Council of Verona took place in 1184. In the struggle against Emperor Frederick I, Verona was one of the leaders of the Lombard League of Cities. It was then shaken by the party fights of the noble parties, the Montecchi (Ghibellines) and the San Bonifazios (Guelphs). At the beginning of the 13th century, the Ezzelini, the protectors of the Montecchi, seized the city. After the death of Ezzelino da Romano (1259), the people of Verona elected Mastino I della Scala as head (Podestà) in 1260, whose family ruled for 127 years and reached its highest power and prosperity under Cangrande I della Scala. In 1387 Verona came under Milan's rule, and in 1405 under Venice's."

The city was first conquered in 839 by Saracens led by one Saba, whose fleet defeated that of the Venetians commissioned by Constantinople to drive out the Muslims. Three years later, there is evidence of the presence of an "Apolaffar" who may have come from the Muslim colony of Crete. The Saracens, i.e. Islamised Arabs and Berbers, established an emirate from 846 to 880. However, this was conquered between 846 and 847 and again between 851 and 852. In 880, the Byzantine commander Leon Apostyppes reconquered the city for Constantinople. Within a decade, a kind of provincial administration emerged, a theme. Nevertheless, the city remained endangered. On 15 August 927, for example, it was sacked and destroyed by Saracens led by the Slav Sabir. It was not until 967 that it was rebuilt by the strategist Nikephoros Hexakionides. The Normans did not succeed in conquering the city until the second half of the 11th century, although Byzantium under Georgios Maniakes still attempted to reconquer Sicily from 1037 to 1043, which succeeded in the eastern part. The territorial foundations of the principality of Taranto were probably laid in 1086. The city still had a strong Greek influence and a flourishing Jewish community. Frederick II bequeathed the principality to his son Manfred. Under the Angevins, the principality was first confiscated, but then bequeathed to Philip, the son of Charles II of Anjou. A class arose within the city that obtained a number of concessions and privileges from the lords. In 1399, Raimondello del Balzo-Orsini obtained the principality. After his death, the principality passed in turn to Maria through her marriage to Ladislaus of Anjou-Durazzo. Aragon finally put an end to this concentration of power. "

In the early 5th century BC, Anaxilas, the tyrant of Rhegion, renamed the city Messene in honour of his home town of Messene in the Peloponnese. Messina was sacked and burned by the Carthaginians in 396 BC, then reconquered by Dionysius I of Syracuse. In 288 BC Messina was conquered by Campanian mercenaries, the so-called Mamertines, who killed all the men and divided their women, children and property among themselves. When Hieron II of Syracuse took action against the continuing threat in 265 BC, the Mamertines called on Carthage and Rome in turn for help, thus providing the impetus for the intervention of the two rising powers in Sicily, which subsequently led to their clash in the Punic Wars. At the end of the First Punic War, Messina was a free city allied with Rome. Soon after, it became part of the province of Sicily. In Roman times, the city was given an important lighthouse. From 42 to 36 BC, Messana, as the Romans called it, was the most important base of Sextus Pompeius during his naval war against Octavian. Until the 9th century, the city experienced economic prosperity as an important trading centre. In 843 the city was conquered by the Arabs, in 1061 by the Normans.

During the First Punic War from 264 to 241 B.C., Palermo was an important Carthaginian stronghold until it was conquered by the Romans through a naval blockade in 254 B.C. and given the name Panormus. Under Augustus, former Roman legionaries settled there and Panormus developed into one of the most important cities in the province of Sicilia. After the Vandals founded their empire in North Africa in 429 with today's Tunisia as its centre, they invaded Sicily several times and conquered the city. Palermo lost importance and finally fell to Ostrom in 535. In 831 Palermo became the capital of the emirs of Sicily and developed into a flourishing economic centre through the cultivation of orange and citrus trees. The port was expanded and new districts were built. The population at the time is estimated at around 100,000 to 120,000. According to Ibn al-Athir, the Muslim Emir Muhammad b. Abdallah b. Aghlab, who ruled Sicily from Palermo from 832 to 851, used the city as a base for incessant looting. Since ancient times, Sicily was the granary of the world at that time and the most coveted agricultural land of the Middle Ages. This made it a bone of contention among political powers. In 1072, the Normans under Roger I conquered Palermo. At the beginning of the 12th century it became the capital of the county, and from 1130 of the kingdom of Sicily. The cultural heyday under the Normans continued when the Staufers took power in 1194. Frederick II expanded the city into a glamorous residence and founded the Sicilian School of Poetry. After the execution of the last Hohenstaufen, Conradin, Sicily came under the rule of Charles of Anjou, who moved the capital of his empire to Naples. Palermo became increasingly dilapidated and the poverty of the population led to the Sicilian Vespers in 1282. This revolt ended Charles' rule in Sicily.  The revolt led to the division of the Kingdom of Sicily into an insular and a continental Sicily. Palermo initially remained the capital of the insular kingdom until 1412, when it fell to the Crown of Aragon and Palermo became the seat only of the viceroys of Sicily. "

Spandau is first mentioned in 1197 and Kopenick in 1209, although these areas did not join Berlin until 1920. The central part of Berlin can be traced back to two towns. Colln on the Fischerinsel is first mentioned in a 1237 document, and Berlin, across the Spree in what is now called the Nikolaiviertel, is referenced in a document from 1244. 1237 is considered the founding date of the city.

As overland travel was relatively difficult, its position on the upper navigable reaches of the river helped it grow by increasing trade. It was connected to the Hanseatic League city of Bremen by the Leine and was situated near the southern edge of the wide North German Plain and north-west of the Harz mountains and so east–west traffic such as mule trains passed through it. Hanover was thus a gateway to the Rhine, Ruhr and Saar river valleys, and their industrial areas which grew up to the southwest and the plains regions to the east and north for overland traffic skirting the Harz between the Low Countries and Saxony or Thuringia.

Before the conquest of Gaul by Julius Caesar in 52 BC, it was the oppidum of the Celtic Mediomatrici tribe. Integrated into the Roman Empire, Metz became quickly one of the principal towns of Gaul with a population of 40,000, until the barbarian depredations and its transfer to the Franks about the end of the 5th century. Between the 6th and 8th centuries, the city was the residence of the Merovingian kings of Austrasia. After the Treaty of Verdun in 843, Metz became the capital of the Kingdom of Lotharingia and was ultimately integrated into the Holy Roman Empire, being granted semi-independent status. During the 12th century, Metz became a republic and the Republic of Metz stood until the 15th century."

Founded around 850, Ulm is rich in history and traditions as a former free imperial city (German freie Reichsstadt). At first, Ulm's significance was due to the privilege of a Konigspfalz, a place of accommodation for the medieval German kings and emperors on their frequent travels. Later, Ulm became a city of traders and craftsmen. One of the most important legal documents of the city, an agreement between the Ulm patricians and the trade guilds (German Grosser Schworbrief), dates from 1397. This document, considered an early city constitution, and the beginning of the construction of an enormous church (Ulm Minster, 1377), financed by the inhabitants of Ulm themselves rather than by the church, demonstrate the assertiveness of Ulm's medieval citizens."

The Duke of Saxony and Bavaria Henry the Lion founded the town of Munich in his territory to control the salt trade, after having burned down the town of Fohring and its bridges over the river Isar. Historians date this event at about 1158. The layout of Munich city, with five city gates and market place, resembled that of Hoxter. Henry built a new toll bridge, customs house and a coin market closer to his home somewhat upstream at a settlement around the area of modern old town Munich. This new toll bridge most likely crossed the Isar where the Museuminsel and the modern Ludwigsbrucke is now located. In 1349, the Black Death ravaged Munich and Bavaria. In the 15th century, Munich underwent a revival of Gothic arts the Old Town Hall was enlarged, and Munich's largest Gothic church – the Frauenkirche – now a cathedral, was constructed in only 20 years."

From 1050 to 1572 the city expanded and rose dramatically in importance due to its location on key trade-routes. King Conrad III (reigning as King of Germany from 1137 to 1152) established the Burgraviate of Nuremberg, with the first burgraves coming from the Austrian House of Raab. With the extinction of their male line around 1189, the last Raabs count's son-in-law, Frederick I from the House of Hohenzollern, inherited the burgraviate in 1193. From the late 12th century to the Interregnum, however, the power of the burgraves diminished as the Hohenstaufen emperors transferred most non-military powers to a castellan, with the city administration and the municipal courts handed over to an Imperial mayor (German Reichsschultheiss) from 1173/74. The strained relations between the burgraves and the castellans, with gradual transferral of powers to the latter in the late 14th and early 15th centuries, finally broke out into open enmity, which greatly influenced the history of the city. The city and particularly Nuremberg Castle would become one of the most frequent sites of the Imperial Diet (after Regensburg and Frankfurt), the Diets of Nuremberg from 1211, after the first Nuremberg diet elected Frederick II as emperor."

During the battles with the Mongols Wroclaw Castle was successfully defended by Henry II the Pious. After the Mongol invasion the town was partly populated by German settlers who, in the ensuing centuries, gradually became its dominant population. The city, however, retained its multi-ethnic character, a reflection of its importance as a trading post on the junction of the Via Regia and the Amber Road. With the influx of settlers, the town expanded and in 1242 came under German town law. The city council used both Latin and German, and the early forms of the name Breslau, the German name of the city, appeared for the first time in its written records. Polish gradually ceased to be used in the town books, while it survived in the courts until 1337, when it was banned by the new rulers, the german speaking House of Luxembourgs. The enlarged town covered around 60 hectares (150 acres), and the new main market square, surrounded by timber-frame houses, became the trade centre of the town."

The earliest written mention of the name Stockholm dates from 1252, by which time the mines in Bergslagen made it an important site in the iron trade. The first part of the name (stock) means log in Swedish, although it may also be connected to an old German word (Stock) meaning fortification. The second part of the name (holm) means islet and is thought to refer to the islet Helgeandsholmen in central Stockholm. According to the Eric Chronicles the city is said to have been founded by Birger Jarl to protect Sweden from sea invasions made by Karelians after the pillage of Sigtuna on Lake Malaren in the summer of 1187. Stockholm's core, was built on the central island next to Helgeandsholmen from the mid-13th century onward.

Permanent settlements appeared only at the beginning of the 1st millennium AD, in the Iron Age, when the area was inhabited by Tavastians. They used the area for fishing and hunting, but due to a lack of archeological finds it is difficult to say how extensive their settlements were. The early settlements were raided by Vikings, and later colonised by Christians from Sweden. They arrived mostly from the Swedish coastal regions of Norrland and Halsingland, and their migration intensified around 1100. Swedes colonized the coastline of the Helsinki region permanently in the late 13th century after the successful Second Crusade to Finland, which led to the defeat of the Tavastians."

###Austria###

 urban_wien_desc:0 "Vienna is the capital, largest city of Austria. Evidence has been found of continuous habitation in the Vienna area since 500 BC, when Celts settled the site on the Danube. In 15 BC, the Romans fortified the frontier city they called Vindobona to guard the empire against Germanic tribes to the north. In 976, Leopold I of Babenberg became count of the Eastern March, a district centered on the Danube on the eastern frontier of Bavaria. This initial district grew into the duchy of Austria. Each succeeding Babenberg ruler expanded the march east along the Danube, eventually encompassing Vienna and the lands immediately east. In 1145, Duke Henry II Jasomirgott moved the Babenberg family residence from Klosterneuburg in Lower Austria to Vienna. From that time, Vienna remained the center of the Babenberg dynasty. In 1440, Vienna became the resident city of the Habsburg dynasty. It eventually grew to become the de facto capital of the Holy Roman Empire in 1437 and a cultural center for arts and science, music and fine cuisine."

To secure the connection across the Danube, the Romans built a wooden earthen fort in the middle of the 1st century, which was replaced by a larger stone fort in the 2nd century. After the 2nd century, Lentia was destroyed several times by Germanic invasions, but survived the storms of the migration of peoples and thus has a continuity of settlement beyond Late Antiquity. In the early Middle Ages, Linz became more important again as the Bavarian duchy advanced eastwards. In 799, the German name of the town was first mentioned in a document as "Linze". In the Raffelstetten customs order (between 902 and 906), Linz is mentioned for the first time as a royal market and customs town. During the rule of the Carolingians, Linz fulfilled market and customs duties for the Traungau. Until 1210 Linz was under the rule of the Babenberg dukes. Under the Babenbergs, Linz developed into a city, which was laid out according to plan in 1207, incorporating the old settlement core. In 1230 the new main square was created. By 1240 Linz had been given a town magistrate and a town seal. The Linz toll was one of the most important sources of income for the Austrian dukes, which helped the city to flourish. In 1335 the acquisition of Carinthia by the Habsburgs was completed there. From the end of the 13th century Linz was the seat of the provincial governor, and thus became the central town of Austria above the Enns. Frederick III even chose the city as his residence and thus made it the centre of the Holy Roman Empire from 1489 to 1493, after Matthias Corvinus had conquered Vienna. On the one hand, this and the court of Duke Albrecht VI, which was in Linz from 1458 to 1462, increased the city's cultural and political importance, but at the same time the demands of court life placed a burden on the city. The first Upper Austrian Diet was held in Enns in 1408."

Jewish chronicler David Solomon Ganz, citing Cyriacus Spangenberg, claimed that the city was founded as Boihaem in 1306 BC by an ancient king, Boyya. In the late 5th century AD, during the great Migration Period following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, the Germanic tribes living in Bohemia moved westwards and, probably in the 6th century, the Slavic tribes settled the Central Bohemian Region. In the following three centuries, the Czech tribes built several fortified settlements in the area, most notably in the sarka valley, Butovice and Levy Hradec. The legendary origins of Prague attribute its foundation to the 8th-century Czech duchess and prophetess Libuse and her husband, Premysl, founder of the Premyslid dynasty. Legend says that Libuse came out on a rocky cliff high above the Vltava and prophesied 'I see a great city whose glory will touch the stars'. She ordered a castle and a town called Praha to be built on the site."

Towards the end of the 11th century the town was incorporated into the Kingdom of Hungary. The settlement core of today's Kosice was formed by a Slavic settlement in today's Kovacska Street. Parallel to this old settlement, whose exact date of origin is unknown, German colonists founded a trading settlement in the neighbourhood at the beginning of the 13th century. Still in the 13th century, the two settlements merged, and the resulting Slavic-German settlement received its first city rights around 1248 as one of the first cities in the kingdom. Shortly before, in 1230, there was the first written mention of the town (as villa Cassa). In the following centuries, Kashov was one of the most important and largest towns in the Kingdom of Hungary. Due to its location on a trade route to Poland and various privileges, trade flourished and its importance grew. The first guild rules have been handed down from 1307. After the defeat of the Aba family by the troops of Charles I at the Battle of Rozhanovce in 1312, several rights were borrowed from the town as compensation. In 1347 Kashov became the second royal free town in the Kingdom of Hungary after the capital Buda. In 1369 the town was granted its coat of arms by King Louis the Great. This was the first sovereign grant of a coat of arms to a legal entity in Europe. Until then, this privilege had only existed for natural persons. In the 14th and 15th centuries, the development of the town reached its peak. In the 15th century, the town played an important role in the Pentapolitana - a union of five towns in present-day eastern Slovakia - Kosice, Presov, Bardejov, Sabinov and Levoca. In the middle of the 15th century it came under the rule of John Giskra. "

In 1242, a Tartar invasion reached the gates of the town, but Spalato held out. In the diadochal struggles following the extinction of the Arpad dynasty (1301), Venice was able to win Spalato back for itself (1327). The city subordinated itself to Venice, which now appointed and dispatched the Comes. He was both chief official of the city and representative of the Doge. The city law was codified in 1312 by Perceval of Fermo in the Libro d'oro (Golden Book). No sooner had a new dynasty, Louis I, established itself and this king defeated Venice in 1357 than it ceded Spalato and the other cities back to Croatia in 1358 in the Peace of Zadar. The death of Louis I in 1382 weakened Hungary, so that in 1390 King Tvrtko I seized the city for his kingdom of Bosnia. But already his successor Stjepan Dabisa had to recognise the suzerainty of Sigismund of Luxembourg, King of Hungary-Croatia (later also Holy Roman Emperor) in 1394 and cede Spalato to him. In 1402, Spalato had to recognise King Ladislaus of Naples, who claimed Dalmatia for himself, as lord, enforced by his viceroy Hrvoje Vukcic Hrvatinic of Dalmatia and Croatia, who henceforth also called himself Duke of Spalato. But when Sigismund defeated Ladislaus, Hrvoje fell away from him and subordinated himself to Sigismund, who forgave him for taking Ladislaus' side in 1403. Duke Hrvoje rose to high-handed tyranny, so the commune expelled him in 1413 and no longer recognised him as duke, quelling a revolt by his partisans in the city. Spalato prevented Hrvoje's return by voluntarily submitting to Venice in 1420. "

 urban_ragusa_desc:0 "The origins of Ragusa can be traced back to the 2nd millennium BC, when there were several Sicel settlements in the area. After the Slavs had driven out the population of Epidaurum, they settled in this city. They also founded a settlement on the mainland at the foot of Mount Sergius opposite the island to which the Roman population had fled, on a piece of land covered by a dense oak forest. Since the oak was called dub in Slavic, the name Dubrovnik was most likely formed from it. Over time, friendly relations developed between the island settlement and the Slavic population on the mainland. In the 12th century, the channel between the mainland and the island was filled in, causing the two settlements to grow together. Ragusa was under the protection of Byzantium since its foundation. Bosnia became an important supplier of raw materials to the city (wood and metals). At the same time, important trade routes to the interior of south-eastern Europe ran through Bosnia. At the time of the Crusades, the city was temporarily under the rule of Venice (1205-1358). In 1242, the city was besieged by the Mongols and the surrounding countryside was devastated. In 1240 and 1244 the alliance with Bosnia was renewed. After the peace treaty of Zadar in 1358, Ragusa recognised the suzerainty of the Croatian-Hungarian kings and paid tribute to them. However, as early as 1420, delegations travelled regularly to the Ottomans, who, in addition to affirming their neutrality, delivered annual tributes. After gaining its autonomy (only tributes in the form of taxes and ships were paid to the Hungarian-Croatian king), Ragusa began its life as an independent Republic of Ragusa. The republic managed to preserve its autonomy and the citizens of the city elected their city council and senate. The patron saint of the city became St. Blasius, a doctor from the time of Diocletian, who, according to tradition, saved Dubrovnik during an attack by the Republic of Venice. In 1416, the Republic of Ragusa was the first city-state in Europe to abolish slavery; at the same time, the slave trade was prohibited by law. "

From 1280 to 1314, Helene d'Anjou ruled over Zeta. From 1360 to 1421, after the disintegration of the Serbian Empire, Zeta was ruled by the local Balsic princes, and the capital was moved to Shkodra.

During the decline of the Roman Empire, the city was raided by Huns, Visigoths, Avars and Slavs. In 809, Serdica was incorporated into the Bulgarian Empire by Khan Krum and became known as Sredets.

When, towards the end of the century, the Bulgarians of Asparuch pushed into the Balkans, Drastar and the Slavic tribe of Severs became part of the Bulgarian Empire. Drastar became the summer residence of the Bulgarian khans, who built their capital in Pliska. After the Christianisation of the Bulgarians in 865, the diocese of Drastar was formed as one of the first dioceses of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. Under Tsar Simeon I, the city had strategic importance in the empire's defensive struggle against the Magyars. In 969, Drastar was one of the first Bulgarian fortresses to be affected by the conquests of the Grand Prince of Kievan Rus, Svyatoslav I. As the expansion of Kievan Rus into the Balkans threatened the political balance of the region, Byzantium under Emperor John Tzimiskes intervened. By 971, the eastern part of the Bulgarian Empire was conquered by Byzantium and Svyatoslav was forced to retreat. The city was given the name Theodoroupolis after the Byzantine reconquest in 971 because the Byzantines attributed it to the help of Saint Theodoros to have defeated Sviatoslav in the fortress of Silistra. In 976, the later Bulgarian emperor Samuil reconquered the region between the Balkan Mountains and the Danube, as well as the city, and resided here. In 1001, the Byzantine Emperor Basileios II sent his army, which subsequently subjugated the region again. For the following decades, Drastar became the centre of the Byzantine province of Paristrion. After 1186, Silistra became part of the Second Bulgarian Empire. After the Battle of Nicopolis in 1396, Silistra fell to the Ottomans. "

The version of the city's name, Candia, Italianised under the Venetians, soon spread to the whole island of Crete. The town of Candia became the residence of the Duca, the "Duke of Crete", appointed by the Republic of Venice. The first duke was Jacopo Tiepolo. The city also became the seat of a Roman Catholic archbishop. The island's landowning aristocracy, newly assembled by the Republic of St Mark, had to be present in the town of Candia and maintain residences befitting their status. The most important trade goods, namely iron, wheat and olive oil, were declared state monopolies. The port was considerably expanded in the first six decades of the 14th century, but this was partially financed in 1359 with the introduction of the tornesello, an artificially overpriced coin that circulated only in the eastern colonies. Nevertheless, from 1229, when the last Greek revolt collapsed, until 1363, there was a long period of prosperity and relative peace on the island, except for the revolt under Alexios Kalergis (1283-1299), which covered almost the entire island. When the Empire of Nikaia succeeded in regaining Constantinople in 1261, thus denying Venice access to the market there for a long time, Candia became the most important Venetian port in the Aegean. Through drastic tax increases, restrictions on the Cretans' trade on their own account in favour of the Venetian long-distance merchant families, as well as lavish services, the Senate provoked uprisings on the island, especially the great revolt of 1363 to 1366. After the recapture of the capital, which was first celebrated in Candia on 10 May 1365, this victory was henceforth celebrated every year with processions and horse races. In the long term, the revolt weakened the influence of the local Venetian nobility and strengthened the Greek families. "

As a result of the 4th Crusade, Corfu came under the rule of the despot of Epiros after 1204. As a dowry of Helen of Epirus, the island had come into the possession of Manfred of Sicily in 1258. From this time onwards, numerous fiefs were issued to Frankish nobles on the island.  After the murder of Philip Chinard, the crusader Garnier l'Aleman took over the administration of Corfu. Charles contacted Garnier l'Aleman and offered him land in the Kingdom of Sicily of an annual value of 100 ounces, or 1000 ounces of gold in cash, for "the whole island of Corfu with castles with country houses and all the lands of the usurpers". In fact, Garnier gave the island to Charles of Anjou in March 1267, who appointed him his captain-general on 20 March 1267 and gradually conquered the despotate of Epirus from 1268. Charles' promise in favour of Garnier could no longer be carried out due to his death. A document dated May 1272 shows that Charles had the promised land of the above-mentioned annual value of 100 ounces or 1000 ounces of gold allotted in cash to the son of the deceased Garnier, Aimone Aleman. In 1271 Giovanni Clariaco became the first Vicar of Corfu. Under Angevin rule, the feudal system of Western European coinage came into full formation. In 1294 the island was transferred from Charles II of Anjou to his son Philip, Prince of Taranto, who in 1330 (or shortly afterwards) appointed Guglielmo II Tocco governor of Corfu.

The city was the home of the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople and guardian of Christendom's holiest relics such as the Crown of thorns and the True Cross. In 1204, however, the armies of the Fourth Crusade took and devastated the city and, for several decades, its inhabitants resided under Latin occupation in a dwindling and depopulated city."  
 urban_sparti_desc:0 "Sparta was a prominent city-state in Laconia in ancient Greece. In antiquity, the city-state was known as Lacedaemon, while the name Sparta referred to its main settlement on the banks of the Eurotas River in Laconia, in south-eastern Peloponnese. Around 650 BC, it rose to become the dominant military land-power in ancient Greece. Beginning in the 13th century, the political and cultural center of Laconia shifted to Mystras, some 4 km to the west. The settlement at ancient Sparta, named Lacedaemonia, continued to exist, although greatly depopulated."  
 urban_theodosian_walls_desc:0 "The Walls of Constantinople are a series of defensive stone walls that have surrounded and protected the city of Constantinople since its founding as the new capital of the Roman Empire by Constantine the Great. With numerous additions and modifications during their history, they were the last great fortification system of antiquity, and one of the most complex and elaborate systems ever built. The double Theodosian Walls, located about 2 km to the west of the old Constantinian Wall, were erected during the reign of Emperor Theodosius, after whom they were named. The work was carried out in two phases, with the first phase erected during Theodosius' minority under the direction of Anthemius, the praetorian prefect of the East, and was finished in 413 according to a law in the Codex Theodosianus. This initial construction consisted of a single curtain wall with towers, which now forms the inner circuit of the Theodosian Walls. Within the following century the second, outer wall was added, as well as a wide moat which opened in front of the walls."

It was one of the greatest and most important Greek cities of the Hellenistic period. The city served as the capital of the Seleucid Empire and later as regional capital to both the Roman and Byzantine Empire. During the Crusades, Antioch served as the capital of the Principality of Antioch, one of four Crusader states that were founded in the Levant. The city's location offered geographical, military, and economic benefits to its occupants; Antioch was heavily involved in the spice trade and lay within easy reach of the Silk Road and the Royal Road. Seleucus encouraged Greeks from all over the Mediterranean to settle in the city. Antioch was part of the pentarchy and was called 'the cradle of Christianity' as a result of its longevity and the pivotal role that it played in the emergence of early Christianity. The Christian New Testament asserts that the name 'Christian' first emerged in Antioch. The city declined to relative insignificance during the Middle Ages due to warfare, repeated earthquakes, and a change in trade routes. The city still lends its name to Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch, one of the most important churches of the Levant and eastern Mediterranean."

In its pre-Roman times it was known as Odrysia, probably in reference to the Thracian tribe of the Odrysians, or Uscudama, and belonged to Thrace. Odrysia was the capital of the Odrysian Empire from the 5th to the 3rd century BC. Between 171 BC and 168 BC, the area was occupied by the Romans. During his reign, Augustus renounced the conquest of Thrace and thus also of the city. Thrace was not conquered until the reign of Emperor Claudius. Hadrian ordered the city to be rebuilt and expanded around 125 AD and gave it the name Hadrianopolis (City of Hadrian). In 378 the Romans under Emperor Valens were defeated there by the Goths (Battle of Adrianople). In 395 the city became the centre of the Roman province of Haemimontus. The city was the seat of the Archbishopric of Hadrianopolis in Haemimonto, which still lives on today as a titular bishopric of the Roman Catholic Church. Around 790-800, the city became the centre of the newly created Byzantine military-administrative district of Macedonia. In subsequent centuries, rule over the city and the subject alternated between the Bulgarian and Byzantine Empires. In 813, the Bulgarians under Khan Krum were victorious over Emperor Michael I in the Battle of Adrianople. Tsar Simeon I reincorporated the province into the Bulgarian Empire in 914. In 927, after the 50-year peace agreement between Bulgarians and Byzantines, much of the subject again came under Byzantine rule. In 1204 Adrianople was conquered by the Crusaders, but fell again into Bulgarian hands after the Battle of Adrianople of 1205. A final Byzantine period followed after 1250, and the Ottomans finally conquered the city in 1362. From 1368 Edirne was the capital of the Ottoman Empire."

###Japan###

 urban_edo_desc:0 "Edo, formerly a jokamachi (castle town) centered on Edo Castle located in Musashi Province. Before the 10th century, there is no mention of Edo in historical records, but for a few settlements in the area. Edo first appears in the Azuma Kagami chronicles, that name for the area being probably used since the second half of the Heian period. Its development started in late 11th century with a branch of the Kanmu-Taira clan called the Chichibu clan, coming from the banks of the then-Iruma River, present day upstream of Arakawa river. A descendant of the head of the Chichibu clan settled in the area and took the name Edo Shigetsugu, likely based on the name used for the place, and founded the Edo clan. Edo later was known as Tokyo."
